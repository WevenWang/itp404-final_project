Theme of the Project: Car Dictionary



1. What problem are you trying to solve?
  To educate more of those who know nothing about cars and let them have a impression of what cars are about


2. Who is the primary audience
  The primary audience would be high school kids college students who know little about cars but are interested in such fields.

3. How will the project requirements be fullfilled?
  The Car disctionary will have full CRUD functionalities, the user would be able to delete/add/edit/read individual entries of the dictionary. The properties of each car entry would be something like gas mileage, number of cylinders, power model and so on. There will be validation of the code using javascript.Bootstrap will be used to keep the page clear, organized and presentable to the user. The ember-moment add-on will be used to format the release-year and model-year properties.


4. Which addon(s) do you think you will use and for what? Explore Ember addons at Ember Observer.
  The ember-moment add-on will be used to format the release-year properties. Maybe ember/test-helper will also be used to help with tests that is required in the instruction.
